## AngularJS Reddit Reader Application
This is an AngularJS project utilizing the single page application (SPA) design. The simple SPA 
has a home page and two partial pages. This application allows the user to choose a technical 
subject and stories about that topic will be retrieved from Reddit and displayed. Page routing 
is setup and a factory and service are used. The stories can be sorted by the number of comments 
on the story.

This project needs to be served on some server. I used NPM http-server during development. Once 
the server is running, open index.html to run application.
